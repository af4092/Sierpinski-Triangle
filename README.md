# Sierpinski-Triangle
Application illustrates the Sierpinski Triangle which is a fractal shape.  Program takes number of order and displays the shapes accordingly.



The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal shape that is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński who described it in 1915. It is a self-similar triangle that is formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into four smaller equilateral triangles and removing the central triangle. This process is repeated on each of the remaining smaller triangles, producing an infinitely complex pattern.

The Sierpinski Triangle is a fascinating example of a fractal, which is a geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity at different scales. In other words, the same basic shape is repeated at smaller and smaller scales, resulting in a pattern that looks similar at all levels of magnification.

The Sierpinski Triangle has many interesting properties and has applications in various fields such as computer graphics, image compression, and chaos theory. It is also a popular subject in recreational mathematics and is often used as an example of a fractal shape.
